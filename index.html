            Parts of the game (no particular order):
                - Display text and a button (once button is pressed, text and button will disappear and another part will appear) {may be good for tutorial/explanation as well}
                - Hide/Show elements and have the player look for the correct one
                - Add/Remove data and/or elements from the page (potentially to display another part)
                - inputting answers quickly (put a timer on the screen and have it connected via JQuery)
                - Double click game (figure out the details later)
