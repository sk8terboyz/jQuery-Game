# jQuery-Game

Author: Shane Kennedy
Languages: HTML, JavaScript, CSS, JQuery

This is supposed to be a heavily JQuery based website. My plan for this is to create the home page as a game that uses different forms of JQuery. The How To page will explain how to play each game and give tips on each of them if need be. The Games page will show each game and allow you to play each one separately from the others rather than the home page where each game has to be played in order. The Creation/Updates page will be used to give updates on what may change, how the system works, and any extra information I feel may be necessary to add later on.

There are a few game plans currently in the index.html file, but each of these games are subject to change/be omitted if something better is found later on as well.
